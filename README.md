# Country-Search Frontend Project

## live demo: https://adoring-colden-3b1cc8.netlify.app/

### A frontend project that the users and search a country by name, check detailed information about a country and add or remove countries in favorite. Also you can toggle the theme colors between red, blue and green. 
### In this project I use React as UI framework, Redux for favorite countries state management, Context API for theme colors state management, bootstrap for styling and typescript as programming language. 
### The countries data are fetched from REST countries api (https://restcountries.com/).
